# 💡 TypeToneSense: Typing Speed & Stress Analyzer

### A Smart Python + AI-based Web App for Real-Time Typing and Emotion Analysis

---

### 🚀 *Overview*

*TypeToneSense* is an intelligent web application that measures your typing performance — including *speed (WPM), **accuracy, and **error rate* — while simultaneously monitoring your *stress level* using *facial emotion analysis*.

Built using *Flask, **OpenCV, and **Machine Learning, this project combines **behavioral analytics* (typing data) and *emotional analytics* (facial expressions) to give you insights into how stress affects your typing performance.


---

### ⚙ *Key Features*

✅ *Real-Time Typing Test* – Measure your typing speed, accuracy, and errors in an interactive interface.
✅ *Facial Emotion Detection* – Detects emotions like Calm, Stressed, Happy, or Tired using your webcam.
✅ *AI-Powered Stress Monitoring* – Uses OpenCV and Haar cascades for facial feature tracking.
✅ *Flask Web App Interface* – Clean and dynamic web UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
✅ *Instant Results Dashboard* – Displays performance metrics and emotion breakdown after each session.
✅ *Lightweight & Portable* – Works locally on any Python environment.
✅ *Future-Ready Design* – Easily extendable to integrate Deep Learning models or databases.

### 💻 *Core Modules*

* app.py → Main Flask backend for routing and API handling.
* face_analyzer.py → AI module for facial expression & stress analysis.
* templates/ → Contains all web pages (index.html, results.html, etc.).
* static/ → CSS, JS, and assets for UI.
* requirements.txt → Dependencies for easy setup.

---

### 🧩 *How It Works*

1. 👨‍💻 *User starts typing test* → Random paragraph appears.
2. 🎥 *Webcam captures face* → OpenCV detects and analyzes expressions.
3. ⚙ *AI interprets stress level* → Based on brightness, eye/mouth variance, and movement.
4. 📊 *Results generated* → WPM, accuracy, and stress summary displayed instantly.

---

### 🔮 *Future Enhancements*

* Integrate *Deep Learning emotion models* (FER2013, AffectNet).
* Add *user authentication & session tracking*.
* Real-time stress graphs with *Chart.js / D3.js*.
* Mobile-friendly responsive design.
* Store data in *MongoDB / PostgreSQL* for persistent tracking.
